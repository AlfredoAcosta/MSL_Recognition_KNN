<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is about Sign Recognition using an Instance Based Modelling Algorithm, in this case: 'K-nearest-neighbords', the selection of the best K is obtained analyzing the accuracy behavior with a proposed validation set. K-Nearest-Neighbords(KNN) it's a simple but powerful algorithm that can deal with image recognition as shown.


### Built With

* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html)
* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
